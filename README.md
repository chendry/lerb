# lerb

Lerb is a Ruby implementation of a Let's Encrypt client.  One day it might even be a general-purpose ACME client!

## Project Goals

1. **Easy installation**.  Lerb is a single Ruby script which depends only on OpenSSL.
2. **Hide nothing**.  Follow the contours of the ACME protocol without adding any behind-the-scenes surprises.
3. **Written for humans**.  No need to RTFM; Lerb's output and helpful error messages should be sufficient.
4. **Scriptability**.  In addition to the default human output, Lerb's script and JSON modes aim to facilitate automating from within shell scripts.
